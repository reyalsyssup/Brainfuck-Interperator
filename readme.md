# BrainFuck Interpreter

### Brief description:
This brainfuck interpreter was written in c++. It has the capability to read from files, output data to the console, and accept input.

### Usage
To interpret a file, the user must type the following:

    interpreter filename.bf

The file's extension doesn't matter, but the contents of the files does. If the interpreter hangs, you may have accidentally created an infinite loop. On windows, type crtl+c to exit the app if this is the case.
